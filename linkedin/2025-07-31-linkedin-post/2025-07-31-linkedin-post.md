‚≠ê Incredible career moment: Just gave my first state-level conference talk at PyOhio 2025!

I wanted to share the story hidden in 21.9 million Python repos about why we make the choices we do as developers.

üéØ THE STORY IN THE DATA

We chase benchmarks, yet UV (10-100x faster) has the LOWEST adoption. Why do we stick with slower tools like pip?

But here's the bigger surprise: 95% of Python projects avoid formal dependency management entirely.

üí° CONTEXT IS KING

This reveals 3 distinct ecosystems making rational choices:
- Educational/Experimental (majority): Avoiding complexity barriers
- Standard Library Maximalists: Using Python's 238 built-in modules
- Production (hidden): Private repos invisible in public stats

The real problem? Community fragmentation + lack of reliable dev automation across these different needs.

üöÄ THE UNIFYING SOLUTION

I built a companion MCP server that doesn't compete - it assists. Works with ANY tool your team uses, syncs official docs weekly, AI automation ready. Stop tool wars, start context-aware decisions.

Beyond the Benchmark: Why the "Best" Python Dependency Manager Might Not Be Best for You

Analysis of 21.9M GitHub repositories reveals the fastest tools often have the lowest adoption rates due to context and switching costs.

Presents a practical decision framework that challenges conventional wisdom about Python dependency tool selection.

## POST IMAGE 2 - ADOPTION STATS

```plaintext
Python Dependency Manager Adoption (21.9M repositories analyzed):

- Pip: 563,200 repos (2.565%) - Dominant market leader, 14x higher than Poetry
- Poetry: 40,320 repos (0.184%) - Leading modern alternative, 2.8x higher than UV  
- Conda: 18,856 repos (0.086%) - Niche data science dominance
- UV: 14,384 repos (0.066%) - Emerging tool with minimal adoption despite 10-100x performance advantage

Key insight: <5% of Python projects use formal dependency management tools, meaning >95% avoid formal dependency management entirely.

## POST IMAGE 3 - THE UNITING SOLUTION

```plaintext
A Uniting Solution: Python Dependency Manager Companion MCP Server

Diagram showing how the companion server unifies four key principles to assist developers across different dependency management ecosystems:

- Fast + Simple: Works with any existing tool without adding complexity
- True to Docs: Syncs with official documentation weekly for accuracy  
- AI Automation Ready: Integrates with agentic IDEs through MCP protocol
- Customizable: Adaptable to team workflows and organizational contexts

Solution addresses community fragmentation by assisting rather than competing with existing tools.

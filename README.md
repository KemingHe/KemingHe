## Project Principles

Note-to-self: keep these in mind while building. [^inspiration]

[^inspiration]: Inspired by a coffee chat with [@JasonSu14](https://github.com/JasonSu14)

1. Commit long-term and commit wisely;
2. Tackle real problems with real solutions;
3. Make it free, open-source, and educational;
4. Keep it legal, professional, and public-serving.

`TODO: migrate to Smol Notes App when ready.`

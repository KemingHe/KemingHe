I build AI automation systems that deliver immediate business impact. 2025 summer at Botcopy, I've accelerated test execution by 11.3x and achieved zero rework while securing government infrastructure.

Recent Impact:
▪️ Spoke at PyOhio 2025 after analyzing 21.9M repositories, revealing why faster tools don't guarantee adoption, and offering unifying solution
▪️ Reduced AI costs by 95% ($20→<$1/month) with Buckeye GPT 
▪️ Won 3rd at Make OHI/O 2025—concept to deployment in 12 hours
▪️ Cut dependencies by 80% and increased speed by 90% at GitHub Socialify

Technical Expertise:
▪️ AI/ML: LangChain, Pinecone Vector DB, Google Gemini
▪️ Full Stack: React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js
▪️ Infrastructure: Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions
▪️ Certifications: GCP Professional Cloud Developer, Terraform Associate

Key Differentiator: 
I combine technical depth with business acumen (CS + Business minor) to deliver solutions that are both elegant and profitable. My track record shows security-first design, consistent on-time delivery, comprehensive test coverage, and scalable infrastructure.

Currently pursuing my CS degree at Ohio State (May 2027) while actively shipping production code.
